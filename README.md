# Kaggle Mercari competition

My entry for the [Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercari-price-suggestion-challenge), for which I had to predict the prices of products based on their names, categorisation, condition etc. 

In the middle of this competition I became very busy with a experimental design problem, so I spent only a few days on it. My solution is therefore not very good, but I did get to apply a bag-of-words model and learnt a bit more about sklearn pipelines. It was a really interesting dataset - I would have liked to have worked on it more.

This was a kernels-only competition, and so there are no installation instructions. The contents of `code/ridge.py` can be pasted into a Kaggle kernel.
